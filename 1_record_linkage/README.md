# Record Linkage

All record linkage was performed using dblink v0.1.0 (https://github.com/cleanzr/dblink). We refer the user to the excellent installation and documentation available with the package.

There are three folders included here -- one for each data set (caswell_voters and geco) and one for collecting the results from record linkage into a single object containing samples from the posterior of the linkage structure (lambdas).

Be sure to complete the record linkage for each data set before collecting the results using the lambdas code.
